      <h2>WHY DO WE NEED BLOOD</h2><hr style="width: 30%; border-top: 2px solid red;">
      <p>Giving blood saves lives. The blood you give is a lifeline in an emergency and for people who need long-term treatments. Many people would not be alive today if donors had not generously given their blood.</p>
      <br><h2>WHY WE NEED YOU TO GIVE BLOOD</h2><hr style="width: 40%; border-top: 2px solid red;">
      <p>We need over 6,000 blood donations every day to treat patients in need across England. Which is why there's always a need for people to give blood. Each year we need approximately 200,000 new donors, as some donors can no longer give blood. Most people between the ages of 17-65 are able to give blood. Around half our current donors are over 45. That's why we need more young people (over the age of 17) to start giving blood, so we can make sure we have enough blood in the future.</p>

      <p>Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing UGG boots and slippers on their downtime, an entirely new era of fashion was carved out. As a result, the desire and love for UGG increased as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed UGG experience. UGG began offering numerous color and style variations on their sheepskin boots and slippers. Cold weather boots for women and men and leather casuals were added with great success. What started as a niche item, UGG sheepskin boots were now a must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More UGG collections followed, showcasing everything from knit boots to sneakers to wedges, all the while maintaining that luxurious feel UGG is known for all over the world. UGG products were now seen on runways and in fashion shoots from coast to coast. Before long, the love spread even further.</p>
